Essay on the Agile Philosophy

My question
Is Git the best approach for version control within game development 

How I aim to answer this quesiton
With my question I aim to discuss the pros and cons of using Git as a method of version control compared to other approaches. I will be looking at research papers that discuss problems and advantages within Git against other, possibly more appropriate, methods of version control. My question will be aimed more towards newly formed teams that may lack the necessary skills needed to make Git effective within their team. Looking at possible fixes and issues that may be present within Git i.e code integrity and authenticity, accidental re-writes and even complete loss of data.
